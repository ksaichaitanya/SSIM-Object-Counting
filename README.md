# SSIM-Object-Counting
with ssim score objects will get counted as we write the logic 

SSIM works on differentiation of an image using 3 dependencies :

Luminance
Contrast
Structure

by using these it devolpes the value (score) 
score differ from 0 to 1 depends on the image or frame.

if the area of vehicle appearence in a frame with empty frame compared then score is different. by constant appearece of score gives the count

in here by using region of interest we can comapre any part of the image or frame from videos.
